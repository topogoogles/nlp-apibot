# Poetry Deploy Guide

## Basic steps to deploy your project

### 1. Install Poetry

If you haven't already installed Poetry, you can do so by following the instructions on the official Poetry website. For most users, the recommended way to install Poetry is via the installer script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project with Poetry

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
poetry init
```

This command will guide you through creating your `pyproject.toml` file, where you'll specify your project's dependencies and other configurations.

### 3. Add Dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project by running:

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

For your project, you might need to add packages like `googlesearch`, `requests`, `lxml`, `beautifulsoup4`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, and `tkinter`. For example:

```bash
poetry add googlesearch requests lxml beautifulsoup4 nltk scikit-learn
```

### 4. Build Your Application

With Poetry, you can build your application by creating a distribution package. This is useful for deployment. Run:

```bash
poetry build
```

This command will create a `.tar.gz` file in the `dist/` directory, which is your application's distribution package.

### 5. Deploy Your Application

The deployment process can vary significantly depending on your target environment (e.g., a web server, a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.). Here's a general approach:

- **For a Web Server**: Upload the `.tar.gz` file to your server and extract it. Then, install the dependencies using `poetry install` and run your application.

- **For Cloud Services**: You might need to create a Docker container for your application. Use the `.tar.gz` file as the base image and install dependencies using a `Dockerfile`. Then, deploy the container to your cloud service.

### Example Dockerfile

Here's a simple `Dockerfile` example to get you started:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY. /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install poetry && poetry install

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "your_app.py"]
```

Replace `your_app.py` with the entry point of your application.

### 6. Push to a Repository

If you're deploying to a cloud service that supports Git (like Heroku), you can push your code to a Git repository and use the service's deployment features.
